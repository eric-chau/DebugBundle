Commands

**container:debug**

A powerful command to find services, parameters and tags inside the ContainerBuilder of BackBee CMS.
This is mostly an adaptation of the Symfony Framework ``container:debug`` command.

Sometimes, you need to check if the routes you have defined are setted correctly: this is exactly
the purpose of this command.
